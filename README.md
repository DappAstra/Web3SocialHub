## Web3 Social Hub (W3SH)
Web3 Social Hub (W3SH) is a project by DappAstra in collaboration with The Graph Foundation, showcasing the power of The Graph technology by unifying decentralized social platforms (DSPs) into one seamless experience.

W3SH aggregates user data such as posts, comments, and profiles from leading decentralized social platforms (currently Lens and Mirror) into a single, cohesive frontend. This allows users to interact with multiple DSPs effortlessly, minimizing fragmentation while boosting efficiency.

## Key Features
Aggregation of Posts: W3SH consolidates posts from supported DSPs, providing a unified social feed.
Seamless Interaction: Users can comment, like, and interact with posts on their native platforms, all from within Web3 Social Hub.
Omni-Chain Publishing: With W3SH, users can publish content across multiple DSPs with a single action.

Unified Analytics: W3SH provides consolidated social insights and analytics for DSP users.

## Supported Platforms

Lens Protocol: Built on Polygon, Lens is fully compatible with The Graph, allowing for indexing of posts, comments, likes, and more.
Mirror: A decentralized blogging platform integrated to expand the publishing and content creation experience.
Future Integrations

W3SH is actively maintained, and we plan to integrate more DSPs in the near future. Our architecture is designed to be adaptable, allowing us to add new platforms seamlessly.

DSP Compatibility Requirements
For DSPs to be indexed by The Graph and integrated into W3SH, they must:

Emit important events via smart contracts for indexing (e.g., account creation, profile updates, posts, interactions).
Ensure key user data is public and accessible on-chain.
Avoid the use of federated networks like ActivityPub, which are not yet compatible with The Graph.
